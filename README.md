#LAB: Full Application
####Build a full back-end application

##Requirements
Create a fully functioning application with authentication and CRUD routes. Make sure your CRUD routes are protected correctly. Who should be able to create data, access data, update data, and delete data.

I chose to make a reading list app. For starters I'd like individuals to be able to add books they want to read to a list. 
Aggregations could include:
group by genre and sort by frequency
books that have been on the list for a certain period of time
Sort alphabetically by author 
Sort alphabetically by title
Sort by time on the list

Users should be able to
add to the list
mark read
delete(or mark no longer interested)
add a note to the entry
see all books they've read
add a rating?

Stretch goal would be adding administrator priviledges? Maybe for a book group or something? To add books to lists of other users.
